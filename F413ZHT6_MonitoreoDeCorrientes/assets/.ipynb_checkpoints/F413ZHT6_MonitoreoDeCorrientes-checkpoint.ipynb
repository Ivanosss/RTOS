    "\n",
    "Implement a tool that is able to administrate sensors to allow the monitoring and gathering of data, which includes movement of waves in the ocean, specifically rip currents. This helps in the establishment of measurements that are crucial in search and rescue operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of the utility of the gathering  of this information is the implementation of a database, where the data collected of the movement of waves can be correlated to the seasons, thus preventing accidents in the shore. Speaking outside the range of this project, this information may be useful to handle natural disasters and other engineering projects in the shore.\n",
    "\n",
    "The software solution consists in two sections: a device that is able to detect the movement of waves and another device that receives this information in the shore. The former periodically reads the movement of waves and transmits the information to the latter, so that the data is able to be processed and analyzed Thus, this involves two tasks: the detection of waves and the connection betwen devices. \n"

It uses a for 4 times, because the value are stored in blocks of 5 values, given the length of 20, it can store 4 values. xQueueReceive [4] returns the first value of the queue, saves it in msg and deletes ir from the queue, that's why it is not necessary to clear the queue. The formatted value of the readings (so that the LoRA can send the message [7]), is saved in buffer6 and sent through huart5. Once the response has been saved in buffer_long, we block the tasks for 1000 ticks to make sure the transmission is complete. And lastly erase the other 4 blocks of the value from the queue.\n",
